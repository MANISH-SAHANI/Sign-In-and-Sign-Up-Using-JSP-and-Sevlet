# Sign-In-and-Sign-Up-Using-JSP-and-Sevlet
 
 These Sign-in and sign-up pages are created using JSPs and Servlets. The user's details are stored in a database, and authentication is done using servlets. The user details are checked against the existing database to verify the identity of the user. Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to the website.

This is the process of creating a web page that allows users to register and log into the application. It provides a secure way to authenticate users and collect user information. By doing so, the application can verify user identity and provide personalized content for each user.


This is the first login screen you see. If you have already registered, you can log in using your username and password.
For example, when users input their username and password, the application will check if it is valid before allowing
access to the rest of the application.  if you are a new user, you can create a new account and proceed with registration.
